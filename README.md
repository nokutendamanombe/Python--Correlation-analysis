**Overview**

The primary objective of this project was to test the hypothesis:

1. Budget is positively correlated with gross revenue.

2. Production company plays a significant role in determining movie success.

Using a dataset of movie performance, the analysis reveals insights through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques.

**Features**

Data Cleaning:

Removed null values and duplicate entries.

Fixed data types for numerical consistency.

Encoded categorical variables for correlation analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculated correlation coefficients to identify key factors influencing gross revenue.

Focused on budget and production company alongside other attributes such as runtime, rating, and genre.

**Data Visualization:**

Bar plots showcasing feature correlations with gross revenue.

Scatter plots with regression lines to display relationships (e.g., budget vs. gross revenue).

Heatmaps for correlation matrix visualization.

**Key Insights**

Budget: Strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.74) with gross revenue.

Production Company: Moderate positive correlation (ρ = 0.15), indicating some influence on revenue.

Other features, such as votes and runtime, also showed significant but smaller correlations.

**Tools & Libraries**
Python: Core programming language for the analysis.

Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

NumPy: Numerical operations.
